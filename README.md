# Artist Information Finder

## Description


Our project is a live web application that can take an artist that a user inputs and display details about that artist.  It displays a profile picture of the artist from spotify, there top tracks, there top albums, a short bio about them, and some artist that are similar to them.  We decided to create this web application to help users become more informed and knowledgeable about there favorite artist and discover new artist.  We did this using HTML to get the basic structuring of our application.  We also used materialize and CSS to further structure and style our application.  We used vanilla JavaScript to add functionality to our website.  We did this using a series of functions, eventlisteners, and for loops.  In order to pull the searched information we used two different APIs: Spotify and audioScrobbler. When all of the code comes together it creates a fully functioning web application designed by five different people.
